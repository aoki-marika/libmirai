/// Some 3DS file formats use this for pointers, where there is an offset u32 for the pointer, which is relative to the beginning of said u32.
/// So to get the absolute offset of that offset within the file, it can add the offset to the current offset of the file handle before reading the offset.
/// @param file The file handle to read the offset from and use the base offset of.
/// @returns The absolute pointer within the file of the offset at the current offset of the given file handle.
